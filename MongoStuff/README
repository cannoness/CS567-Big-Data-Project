Vanessa Job - November 17, 2016

The output is in USATweets.user-id_str.id_str.  

The program used to get the output is in ourgetUSATweets.py.   I ran it from moons.cs.unm.edu and it had no problem getting to the
database. 

The less elegant javascript version is in command.js.  To use it, get on moons and then type

 mongo mongodb.cs.unm.edu:27017/qrgroupdb -u vanessa -p job < command.js > m_output

This runs the mongo shell using input commands from command.js.  The output is redirected to m_output.
